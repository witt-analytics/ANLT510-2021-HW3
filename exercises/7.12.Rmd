## Exercise 7.12

__This problem is a continuation of the previous exercise. In a toy example with $p = 100$, show that one can approximate the multiple linear regression coefficient estimates by repeatedly performing simple linear regression in a backfitting procedure. How many backfitting iterations are required in order to obtain a “good” approximation to the multiple regression coefficient estimates? Create a plot to justify your answer.__
